/**
 * Analyze the custom property implementation below.
 * Identify at least 3 issues or missed opportunities and explain:
 * 1. What is wrong or could be improved?
 * 2. Why is it a problem?
 * 3. How would you fix it?
 * 
 * I think they should add a variable that is a text-color and set it to white since the value of white is assigned
 * more than once. It seems rather silly to make btncolor it's own variable if it is just going to be the same color
 * of blue. If that is the way you want to do it, I would separate the root so it has a button and a color section. 
 * If I were to take the button thing farther, I would use calc and figure out the different button states I could
 * make using the lightness and chroma. I also think that padding could be built out more instead of being specific
 * to the card-padding, because something else assigns padding as well, and I think it would be more efficient and
 * helpful if padding was a consistent amount that could be applied to many things. 
 
 * Consider: naming, scoping, fallbacks, organization, performance
