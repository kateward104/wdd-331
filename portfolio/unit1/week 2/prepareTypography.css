/**
 * Analyze this typography system and identify:
 * 1. What typography principles are being violated?
 * 2. What improvements would you recommend?
 * 3. How would you reorganize this using custom properties?
 * 
 * It looks like the width for p is the entire page, which should not be the case. This will make it much too long
 * to read, and they should use max-width: 66ch to create an appropriate reading distance. Clamp is also not being
 * used here. All of the font sizes are being hard coded, which is not creating proper visual space either. Using
 * custom properties and making both the spacing and text size usable with clamp will help to give the lines their
 * proper space in proportion to everything, as well as the optimal size for responsiveness. I would also just be
 * aware of what code is being copied again, both body and p are saying the font-size is 16, but if p is the only
 * thing in the body then it is redundant, if not, then there should be more hierarchy created by changing the other
 * text inside the body.
 * 
 * Consider: scale, measure, line height, rhythm, responsiveness
