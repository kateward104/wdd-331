/**
 * Analyze this CSS organization:
 * 1. What is the layer precedence order (lowest to highest)?
 *    The layer order is base, then components, then utilities. It should be from lowest to highest in the order
 *    it is written. 
 * 2. If both rules target the same button, which color wins?
 *    Red will win because utilities is a higher layer than base.
 * 3. Why does layer order matter more than specificity here?
 *    Because if you think about it like a sandwich, even if you want your meat a very specific way, and you put
 *    cheese on top, the cheese will be closer to the top. There is specificity in each of the layers, but the layer
 *    order is what matters most.
 * 4. When would you NOT use layers for a project?
 *    If the project is small, if you are doing the project on your own, and if you don't have any specificity
 *    issues, then you should not use layers.
