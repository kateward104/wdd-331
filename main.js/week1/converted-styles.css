/* ===== CONVERSION FROM SASS ===== */
/*  What was straightforward to convert?
        The varible conversion was fairly easy. Once I understood the color ratio of the color-mix, it was easy to convert it.

    What required creative problem-solving?
        The @mixin was complicated to understand, which made it complicated to convert as well. I haven't had a lot of experience making
        a base variable as well, so I am still not 100% sure if I did it the most efficient way. Not to mention the fact that the assignment
        says that the HTML will need to be changed to acommodate for that, and since we don't see the HTML, it was hard to know if I did it 
        the right way. 

    How did you handle the mixin pattern?
        I made a button base class and set the background colors for the individual button classes. I did double check with ChatGPT to see
        if that was a solution that worked for this, and it said I was on the right track. I think that for the most part, I understand the
        concept of conversion, and it was interesting to see the different formats of code, but I am still unsure if I did everything 
        efficiently. 

    What are the advantages of native CSS over preprocessors for this code?
        Well, as we have learned, setting custom variables, allows us to change things very quickly and easily. This helps with calculations,
        and I would say that using color-mix, gives us more control over color manipulation. I also liked how nesting did carry over in some
        cases, the syntax just needed to change a bit. I think this is one thing that is important no matter what you are using to code in. 
    
    Are there any scenarios where the preprocessor version might still be preferable? 
        I am not sure, though I can see why the @mixin would be something fun to play around with. I don't think it is sustainable, but it is fun.
        I think I would have to see it used more in HTML to really understand its capabilities. */

/* ===== CONVERSION FROM LESS ===== */

/*  What was straightforward to convert?
        The variables were pretty easy to convert, as well as the lighten and darken.    

    What required creative problem-solving?
        Nothing from this was particularly difficult since it the changes were very similar to the SASS conversion. This had a similar
        problem of the hypothetical HTML needing to be changed to adapt for the new button base class. I hoped that I being able to change it
        would allow for my solution to run, but without changing the HTML, I don't know for sure. I did check ChatGPT to see if there were
        any large problems with either pieces of code and it just confirmed that the HTML would need to be changed to apply some of my CSS,
        but that it should work. 

    How did you handle the mixin pattern?
        I treated it the same I did in the SASS conversion. I tried to break up the different button styles to be their own classes since I 
        wasn't able to see the CSS. I would like to see how others did their assignments. Theoretically, another way would be to simply target
        a "button" itself, which would create a default style and then hopefully the class can provide additional styles, but I feel that might
        be thrown up in the air since we don't see the HTML. For my own document, I think I would go this route, but I didn't feel right 
        committing to it this time without seeing the HTML.
    
    What are the advantages of native CSS over preprocessors for this code?
        I think it is very similar to the SASS conversion. I appreciate the ease of custom properties, and the nesting helps to organize the code
        and make changes that will be easy to see consistently through the document. Color-mix also gives more flexibility.I would like to 
        go over where and when using "&" is appropriate. 

    Are there any scenarios where the preprocessor version might still be preferable?
        I did enjoy that LESS was much smaller than SASS was, which helped with conversion a lot. Again, I don't think I have seen the 
        preprocessor in action as much so it is difficult to say without having more experience with it.
